My name is Trent You and I'm 23 years old. I grew up living in many different places around the world, though I spent most of it living in the Bay Area in California. At the moment I'm living in Morden, Manitoba in Canada.

I have a B.S. in Neurobiology, Physiology and Behavior from the University of California, Davis. 

After graduating college, I had second thoughts about my plan to go to medical school. I realized I was more passionate about writing code, and decided to go back to school. I'm currently applying to second bachelor programs in Computer Science.
