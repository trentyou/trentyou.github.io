My name is Trent You and I'm a 24 year old iOS developer.

I have a B.S. in Neurobiology, Physiology and Behavior from the University of California, Davis, although I am currently pursuing a second degree in Computer Science at the University of British Columbia. 

I am very passionate about programming in general, specifically iOS development.
