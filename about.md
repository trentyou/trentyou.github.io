My name is Trent You and I'm 23 years old. I grew up living in many different places around the world, though I spent most of it living in the Bay Area in California. At the moment I'm living in Morden, Manitoba in Canada.
I have a degree in Neurobiology, Physiology and Behavior from the University of California, Davis. Currently I'm applying to second bachelor programs in Computer Science.
