# Short bio or description (displayed in the header)
description: Hey, my name is Trent! I graduated college with a degree in Biology in 2013 and I was thinking about a health profession but...I figured I was more passionate about coding. I switched into a second Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, and this is my blog about my experiences. 

I started off developing iOS applications but now I am doing mostly school assignments these days (they take up all your time). 

*Any posts about my experiences at Amazon are solely my own opinions and do not express the views of the company.
