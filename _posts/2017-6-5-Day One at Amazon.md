Last summer in 2016 I began an internship at Amazon Vancouver. I never got around to blogging my experiences like I planned to, which was a shame because I had an incredible time and met some of the best people I've ever had the chance to meet.

Well, I'm doing it now, here in Summer 2017 because I'm back here again at Amazon. I'm spending time blogging this mostly because I feel guilty about not doing it before, so here we go!



_As a legal side note, these posts about my experiences at Amazon are solely my own opinions and do not express the views of the company._

**Let's start with the first day here in Vancouver:**
