Last summer in 2016 I began an internship at Amazon Vancouver. I never got around to blogging my experiences like I planned to, which was a shame because I had an incredible time and met some of the best people I've ever had the chance to meet.

Well, I'm doing it now, here in Summer 2017 because I'm back here again! Hopefully these experiences will help other people who are curious about an internship at Amazon.

**Let's start with the first day here in Vancouver:**
